My rating: **\***

Description: This is a short, well written and practical introductory tutorial to API's. It uses a well thought out exercise with the fetch API and vanilla JavaScript to build a simple app and in the process touches on useful techniques including:

- error handling.
- testing endpoints with postman.
- debugging with the network tab in dev tools.
- concepts and terminology.
- JSON.

Alex also introduces helpful resources, including a currated index of API's, and no-code solutions such as Zapier and IFTTT.

## Markdown

  This is a good way to get the semantics of markdown down quickly and begin composing elegant documentation.

  The tutorial is a series of exercises, presented in sequence and you have to either complete or skip each section to move through the tutorial. This makes it a little tedious to use a refresher if for example, you are trying to brush up on a particular subject.

  A clickable index would be an improved user experience, but even so it is the best markdown tutorial I have come across.
