My rating: **\***

Description: This is a short, well written and practical introductory tutorial to API's. It uses a well thought out exercise with the fetch API and vanilla JavaScript to build a simple app and in the process touches on useful techniques including:

- error handling.
- testing endpoints with postman.
- debugging with the network tab in dev tools.
- concepts and terminology.
- JSON.

Alex also introduces helpful resources, including a currated index of API's, and no-code solutions such as Zapier and IFTTT.

  This is a great way to get the semantics of markdown down quickly and begin composing elegant documentation. It wastes not time getting down to useful material and I find myself running through the tutorial from time to time as a refresher.
